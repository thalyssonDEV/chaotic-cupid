# Chaotic-Cupid

**Description**  
**Chaotic Cupid** is a game developed for the 2nd **internal GameJam** at the Laboratory of Robotics, Automation, and Systems (LABIRAS). The objective of the game is simple: the player controls a **cupid** who must shoot arrows at enemies that approach him, with specific colors. When hitting **pairs of enemies of the same color**, the enemies disappear, and the player earns points. The main objective is to **survive as long as possible** and avoid being hit by the enemies.

## Game Mode

The game takes place in a field where the **cupid** (main character) is in the center. Enemies of different colors start to appear randomly and walk toward the cupid. The player must shoot **arrows** at the enemies, hitting **pairs of enemies of the same color**, to eliminate them. Each pair eliminated grants points and helps the cupid survive for a longer time.

### Rules:
- Shoot at enemies of **the same color** to eliminate them.
- Enemies of different colors cannot be eliminated together, which increases the difficulty.
- The goal is to **survive as long as possible** while facing an increasing number of enemies.
- The game ends when the enemies reach the cupid and his life reaches zero.

## Mechanics

- **Controls**: The cupid is controlled by the player using the arrow keys (or mouse) and can shoot arrows in any direction.
- **Enemies**: Enemies appear randomly from different directions and move toward the cupid. They have **random colors** and must be eliminated in pairs of the same color.
- **Points**: Every time the player eliminates a pair of enemies of the same color, they earn points.

## Technologies Used

- **Godot Engine**: Game engine used for the development of the project.
- **GDScript**: Programming language used to implement the game mechanics.
- **Art**: The game's art was created within the team using internal and free resources.
- **Audio**: Sounds and sound effects created or licensed for the game.
